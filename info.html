    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Passwords Matter</h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Passwords are the gatekeepers of our digital lives. They protect personal emails, bank accounts, healthcare records, 
        and private conversations. Without strong password practices, even the most advanced systems can be left vulnerable.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        In this article, we explore the history of passwords, how they’re used today, and what the future may look like. 
        Understanding their evolution helps us appreciate both their strengths and weaknesses in a rapidly changing digital world.

    <!-- History -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">A Brief History of Passwords</h2>
      <img src="assets/history.jpg" alt="Password history" class="rounded-lg shadow mb-6">
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The earliest “passwords” can be traced back thousands of years. Ancient Roman soldiers used watchwords to gain 
        access to guarded areas. These words changed daily and were passed carefully along the ranks.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In the 1960s, at MIT, the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) became the first computer system to implement 
        passwords. Each user had a private account and needed a password to log in. This innovation introduced a 
        security model still in use today.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        By the 1990s, as the internet grew, password breaches began to surface. Hackers exploited weak or reused 
        passwords, highlighting the need for stronger practices.
      </p>

    <!-- Today -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Passwords Today</h2>
      <img src="assets/today.jpg" alt="Modern password use" class="rounded-lg shadow mb-6">
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        In today’s world, passwords guard almost every aspect of digital identity. Unfortunately, studies show that 
        many people still use weak passwords like “123456” or reuse the same password across multiple accounts.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Security experts recommend long, unique passwords for every account. Password managers make this possible 
        by generating and storing them securely. Two-factor authentication (2FA) further strengthens security by 
        requiring an additional step, such as a phone code or fingerprint scan.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        In 2024, reports indicated that over 80% of data breaches involved compromised or weak passwords. This 
        statistic underscores the importance of practicing good password hygiene.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Future -->
    <section>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Future of Passwords</h2>
      <img src="assets/future.jpg" alt="Future of security" class="rounded-lg shadow mb-6">
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The future may see the decline of traditional typed passwords. Tech giants like Google and Apple are 
        rolling out <strong>passkeys</strong> — unique digital keys stored on a user’s device, unlocked by biometrics 
        or PINs. These are harder to steal or guess than conventional passwords.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Biometrics, such as facial recognition and fingerprint scanning, are becoming mainstream. Combined with 
        AI-driven authentication, future systems will analyze user behavior (typing speed, location, device) to 
        detect unusual patterns and stop attackers in real time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        While no system is flawless, these innovations point to a world where the stress of remembering dozens 
        of complex passwords may finally come to an end.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Best Practices for Strong Passwords</h2>
      <img src="assets/best-practices.jpg" alt="Password tips" class="rounded-lg shadow mb-6">
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700">
        <li>Use at least 12–16 characters (longer is stronger).</li>
        <li>Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.</li>
        <li>Avoid common words, names, or repeated sequences.</li>
        <li>Never reuse the same password across different accounts.</li>
        <li>Update your most important passwords regularly.</li>
        <li>Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication wherever possible.</li>
      </ul>
